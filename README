NAME
    App::cpanm::meta::checker - Verify and sanity check your installation
    verses cpanm meta files

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
        cpanm-meta-checker --all --verbose

DESCRIPTION
    "cpanm" installs a few auxiliary files:

        $SITELIB/.meta/DISTNAME-DISTVERSION/MYMETA.json
        $SITELIB/.meta/DISTNAME-DISTVERSION/install.json

    These files describe several things, such as dependencies declared by
    upstream, and sniffed extra context.

    This tool exists to read those files, and verify that their dependencies
    are still holding true, that no new conflicting dependencies have been
    installed and are silently sitting there broken.

    Also, as "cpanm"'s auxiliary files are really a prototype for what may
    eventually become a tool-chain standard, this tool is also a prototype
    for a tool-chain standard checker.

METHODS
  "check_path"
        ->check_path('./foo/bar/baz');

    Read the content from "./foo/bar/baz" and check its consistency.

  "check_release"
        ->check_release('Moose-2.000000')

    Read the meta-data for the exact release stated and perform checks on
    it.

  "check_distname"
        ->check_distname('Moose')

    Check meta-data for any dist(s) named "Moose"

    Note: There may be directories residual from past installs.

  "check_all"
        ->check_all

    Check meta-data for all installed distributions.

DEFAULT TEST SET
        list_empty
        list_duplicates
        check_runtime_requires
        check_runtime_recommends
        check_runtime_suggests
        check_runtime_conflicts

AVAILABLE TEST SET
  "list_duplicates"
    For now, it includes output about every instance where there are more
    than one set of meta files.

    This occurs, because installing a new version of something doesn't purge
    the data ( or all the files ) of the old one.

  "list"
    This lists all distributions seen.

  "list_empty"
    This lists distributions that have a directory for a meta file, but have
    no meta file in them. ( Rare )

  "list_nonempty"
    This lists distributions that have meta files.

  "check_PHASE_TYPE"
    There is a check for each combination of:

        PHASE: configure build runtime test develop
        TYPE:  requires recommends suggests conflicts

    Each checks the meta-data for conforming dependencies.

    For instance:

        check_runtime_requires # Report Runtime requirements that are unsatisfied
        check_develop_requires # Report Develop requiremetns that are unsatisifed
