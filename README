App::cpanm::meta::checker

"cpanm" installs a few auxiliary files:

    $SITELIB/.meta/DISTNAME-DISTVERSION/MYMETA.json
    $SITELIB/.meta/DISTNAME-DISTVERSION/install.json

These files describe several things, such as dependencies declared by
upstream, and sniffed extra context.

This tool exists to read those files, and verify that their dependencies
are still holding true, that no new conflicting dependencies have been
installed and are silently sitting there broken.

Also, as "cpanm"'s auxiliary files are really a prototype for what may
eventually become a tool-chain standard, this tool is also a prototype
for a tool-chain standard checker.
