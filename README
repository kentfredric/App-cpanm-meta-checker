NAME
    App::cpanm::meta::checker - Verify and sanity check your installation
    verses cpanm metafiles

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
        cpanm-meta-checker --all --verbose

DESCRIPTION
    "cpanm" installs a few auxilary files:

        $SITELIB/.meta/DISTNAME-DISTVERSION/MYMETA.json
        $SITELIB/.meta/DISTNAME-DISTVERSION/install.json

    These files describe several things, such as dependencies declared by
    upstream, and sniffed extra context.

    This tool exists to read those files, and verify that their dependencies
    are still holding true, that no new conflicting dependencies have been
    installed and are silently sitting there broken.

    Also, as "cpanm"'s auxilary files are really a prototype for what may
    eventually become a toolchain standard, this tool is also a prototype
    for a toolchain standard checker.

METHODS
  "check_path"
        ->check_path('./foo/bar/baz');

    Read the content from "./foo/bar/baz" and check its consistency.

  "check_release"
        ->check_release('Moose-2.000000')

    Read the metadata for the exact release stated and perform checks on it.

  "check_distname"
        ->check_distname('Moose')

    Check metadata for any dist(s) named "Moose"

    Note: There may be directories residual from past installs.

  "check_all"
        ->check_all

    Check metadata for all installed dists.

CURRENT TEST SET
  "list_duplicates"
    For now, it includes output about every instance where there are more
    than one set of metafiles.

    This occurs, because installing a new version of something doesn't purge
    the data ( or all the files ) of the old one.

  "list"
    This lists all dists seen.

  "list_empty"
    This lists dists that have a directory for a meta file, but have no meta
    file in them. ( Rare )

  "list_nonempty"
    This lists dists that have metafiles.

  "check_runtime_requires"
    This reports cases where metadata's declarations of "runtime"
    requirements are unsatisfied.
